memorial day a shadow for each white cross
spring rain as the doctor speaks i think of lilacs
spring moonset a rice ball for breakfast
sunny afternoon an old man lingers near the mailbox
cinco de mayo horses roll in the shallows
quitting time the smell of rain in the lobby
waves slowly cresting towards shore a faint moon
overnight rain the scent of orange blossoms in a desert town
misty summer rain calling pheasant in Zen temple
day is done poppies amidst the dying grass
watching clouds the white petals of a crushed crocus
mountain stream two well placed rocks the path home
night shift in the parking lot car lights dim near morning
a wild violet on the sunny hill noon time nap
a sunny day pink haze of the cherry blossoms over the hill
polished oak the freesia's shadow ends in coffee foam
nobody here a table in the mountain speckled with petals
first date not even noticing the new moon
vanishing difference gliding geese settle onto their reflections
distant hawk a gust of cherry petals crosses the lawn
Orange sunrise peaks through The tubes and wires of father's Life support machine
moonlessness so many ways I want to touch you
earth day even the shadows at dusk smell green
so cold a goose honks its way across the night sky
damp straw the day old colt mesmerized by the radio
prying at the window wind
in winter's wind the call of a friend who now has cancer
rainy bridge the river flowing faster
spring breeze the balcony's shadows on my book
winter drizzle all the passing faces look into the cafe
smells of spring adrift in the morning air bubbles under ice
Spring morning your hand on my breast a bird
crossroads the brown core of an apple
hot afternoon a flirting couple in the memorial's shade
last red in the sky a small girl's moon face rises over the counter
day moon the woman with silver hair steps back into the shade
morning delivery snow comes in with the FedEx man
Easter an anxious mother calls in the wind
windless day the prolific weeds at the grave site
Spring day cool and grey cup of tea
Grey today the waves rush memories
Spring equinox Pray the ancestor grave In cold rain
folding chair the newborn colt tries to stand
scattered sun one chickadee louder than the rest
orthopaedic clinic a three legged chair outside the entrance
the plane's landing lights a wave of barking sweeps the neighbourhood
the way grass parts as the pheasant passes spring's end
at half mast a butterfly passes by the still flag.
